Ease to develop
Tableau: Pre-built connections to multiple data types, prompt feedback, easiest
Python: many packages available, active community, simple coding for data manipulation, 2th easiest
D3: build graph from scratch, much coding for data manipulation, hardest
Ease to maintain the visualization
Tableau: Pre-built functions to handle more data, easiest
Python: Matplotlib can adjust graphics automatically, 2th easiest
D3: Need to fix width, height, margin, parameter ratio, hardest
Usability of visualization developed
D3: Excellent Visualization with many graphical choices and interactions, best
Tableau: Visualization with some interaction, moderate
Python: Flat Visualization with many graphical choices, moderate
Scalability of visualization to “large” datasets
Python: Best Scalability with fast-growth data
D3: Fair Scalability with slow DOM manipulations
Tableau: Worst Scalability with software limit
System requirements to run the visualization
D3: Best, Only Browser Needed
Python: Fair, Free IDE available but some installation needed 
Tableau: Worst, Need commercial license and installation
